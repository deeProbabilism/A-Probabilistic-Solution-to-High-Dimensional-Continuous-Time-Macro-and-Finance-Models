# Multi-Country Macro-Finance

This repository contains code and experiments for solving the multi-country macro-finance example with the deep learning-based BSDE approach. The detailed exposition of the example can be found in Section 3 of the paper titled "The Probabilistic Solution of High-Dimensional Continuous-Time Macro and Finance Models" by Ji Huang. The link to the paper is https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4122454.

The primary comparison is between the backward Euler scheme based on BSDE and the PDE approach (i.e., PINN).

Yu Jinghai, Geng Bojun, and Wang Xiankang have made contributions at various stages of the probject.
